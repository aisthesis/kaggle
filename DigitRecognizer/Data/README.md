Information about raw data
==========================

From Kaggle:

"The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

The data files train.csv and test.csv contain gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits, from zero through nine.

The training data set, (train.csv), has 785 columns. The first column, called "label", is the digit that was drawn by the user. The rest of the columns contain the pixel-values of the associated image.

The test data set, (test.csv), is the same as the training set, except that it does not contain the "label" column."
